# challenge-week-14

This is the start of what my tutur and i got on the week 14 homework. This one was super tough to build from scratch and i heavily relied on code and methods i learned from throughout the previous weeks. 

However, this is almost completed and i feel super confident about it. 

I know a couple pieces are missing. Like the general js functionality. however, im super excited to work on this in the future.
